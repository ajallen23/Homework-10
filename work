#Data Background

1. Load the accident data, plot latitude and longitude on a map.

```{r}
acc %>% filter(LONGITUD < 0) %>% ggplot(aes(x = LONGITUD, y = LATITUDE)) + geom_point()

states %>% ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat)) + geom_path(aes(group = group)) + geom_point((aes(x = LONGITUD, y = LATITUDE)), size = 0.05, color = 'red', data = acc %>% filter(LONGITUD <0, LONGITUD > -130))
```

#Part 1: Accedent Data

1. Are there some days of the week where more accidents happen than on others (use variable DAY_WEEK)?

```{r}
table(acc['DAY_WEEK'])
```
*We can see by this table that Sunday has the highest number of accidents then is goes Satuday, Monday, Friday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday.*

2. What time of the day do accidents happen (use variable HOUR)?

```{r}
table(acc['HOUR'])
```
*Most of the accients happen at 6 pm in the evening.*

3. What is the number of accidents with at least one drunk driver (use variable DRUNK_DR)?

```{r}
acc1 <- acc %>% filter(DRUNK_DR >= 1)
length(acc1$DRUNK_DR)
```
*There is 8,720 accidents with at least one drunk driver.*

#Part two: Connecting data

1. Connect to the person table. Join accident and driver table (work out which variable(s) to use).Identify drivers (PER_TYP == 1, see fars manual ) and subset on them. 


```{r}
acc_per <- left_join(acc, per, by = 'ST_CASE')

subset(acc_per, PER_TYP == 1)
```
*Here I joined the accident data and the person data togehter by ST_CASE because that was the most consistant data between the two data sets. Then I subset the acc_per for PER_TYP to equal 1.*

2. Tally the number of accidents by day of the week (DAY_WEEK), hour of the day (HOUR) and gender (SEX). Visualize the results!

```{r}
acc_per %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK) %>% tally() 
ggplot(acc_per, aes(x = DAY_WEEK)) + geom_bar()
```
*Here is by days of the week* 

```{r}
acc_per %>% group_by(HOUR.x) %>% tally() 
ggplot(acc_per, aes(x = HOUR.x)) + geom_bar()
```
*Here is by hours.There is a huge gap in the graph due to the fact that the data inputted 99 for the last hour of the day so now our graph seems to have a huge outlie. *

```{r}
acc_per %>% group_by(SEX) %>% tally() 
ggplot(acc_per, aes(x = SEX)) + geom_bar()
```

*Here is by sex, we can see here that there is strange outliers when it comes to sex. There is 8 and 9 being used to describe the sex of someone though in the data I thought there would be only two sexs.*
